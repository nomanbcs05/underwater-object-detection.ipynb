# underwater-object-detection.ipynb
This project uses the YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect and classify underwater objects such as marine debris, fish, and submerged structures. Trained on annotated images with varied lighting, turbidity, and depth, the model delivers high accuracy and real-time performance in challenging underwater conditions.
